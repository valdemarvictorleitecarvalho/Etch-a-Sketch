# Etch-a-Sketch

Welcome to my **Etch-a-Sketch** repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic drawing game, where users can interactively "sketch" on a grid by progressively darkening squares with each hover. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice JavaScript, CSS, and DOM manipulation.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform where I can:

- Build a fully functional **Etch-a-Sketch game** with customizable grid size.
- Enhance understanding of **JavaScript** by implementing interactive drawing logic and grid generation.
- Practice **CSS styling** and **responsive design** to make the grid visually appealing.
- Learn to use **event listeners** to detect user input (hover) and dynamically update the grid.
- Improve skills in **HTML structure** and **UI/UX design** for better user experience.

## Technologies

This repository uses core web development technologies:

- **HTML5**: For setting up the basic layout and structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the grid, squares, and overall page design.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the drawing logic, random color generation, opacity change, and dynamic updates to the grid.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Drawing**: Users can "sketch" by hovering over squares, which change color and progressively darken.
- **Random Color on First Hover**: The first hover on a square fills it with a random color.
- **Progressive Darkening**: Each subsequent hover darkens the square by increasing its opacity until it's fully opaque.
- **Customizable Grid**: Users can specify the number of squares per side to create a grid of any size (up to 100x100).
- **Responsive Design**: The grid adapts to the container size and is responsive across devices.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Etch-a-Sketch.git
